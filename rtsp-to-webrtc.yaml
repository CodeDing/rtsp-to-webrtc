# General parameters

# Sets the verbosity of the program; available values are "error", "warn", "info", "debug".
logLevel: debug
# Destinations of log messages; available values are "stdout", "file" and "syslog".
logDestinations: [stdout]
# If "file" is in logDestinations, this is the file which will receive the logs.

# Timeout of read operations.
readTimeout: 10s
# Timeout of write operations.
writeTimeout: 10s
# Number of read buffers.
# A higher value allows a wider throughput, a lower value allows to save RAM.

# HTTP URL to perform external authentication.
# Every time a user wants to authenticate, the server calls this URL

# If the response code is 20x, authentication is accepted, otherwise

# WebRTC parameters

# Disable support for the WebRTC protocol.
webrtcDisable: no
# Address of the WebRTC listener.
webrtcAddress: :9001
# Enable TLS/HTTPS on the WebRTC server.
webrtcEncryption: no
# Path to the server key.
# This can be generated with:
# openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
webrtcServerKey: server.key
# Path to the server certificate.
webrtcServerCert: server.crt
# Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header provided in every HTTP response.
# This allows to play the WebRTC stream from an external website.
webrtcAllowOrigin: '*'
# List of IPs or CIDRs of proxies placed before the WebRTC server.
# If the server receives a request from one of these entries, IP in logs
# will be taken from the X-Forwarded-For header.
webrtcTrustedProxies: []
# List of ICE servers, in format type:user:pass:host:port or type:host:port.
# type can be "stun", "turn" or "turns".
# STUN servers are used to get the public IP of both server and clients.
# TURN/TURNS servers are used as relay when a direct connection between server and clients is not possible.
# if user is "AUTH_SECRET", then authentication is secret based.
# the secret must be inserted into the pass field.
#webrtcICEServers: [stun:stun.l.google.com:19302]
# List of public IP addresses that are to be used as a host.
# This is used typically for servers that are behind 1:1 D-NAT.
webrtcICEHostNAT1To1IPs: []
# Address of a ICE UDP listener in format host:port.
# If filled, ICE traffic will come through a single UDP port,
# allowing the deployment of the server inside a container or behind a NAT.
webrtcICEUDPMuxAddress: 
# Address of a ICE TCP listener in format host:port.
# If filled, ICE traffic will come through a single TCP port,
# allowing the deployment of the server inside a container or behind a NAT.
# At the moment, setting this parameter forces usage of the TCP protocol,
# which is not optimal for WebRTC.
